    "\n",
    "Banks play a crucial role in market economies. They decide who can get finance and on what terms they can make or break investment decisions. For markets and society to function, individuals and companies need access to credit. Nowadays there are many risks related to lending loans, especially for the banks so as to reduce their capital loss. The analysis of risks and assessment of default becomes crucial thereafter. Banks hold huge volumes of customer behavior related data from which they are unable to arrive at a judgment if an applicant can be defaulter or not. Credit Risk assessment is a crucial issue faced by Banks nowadays which helps them to evaluate if a loan applicant can be a defaulter at a later stage so that they can go ahead and grant the loan or not. This helps the banks to minimize the possible losses and can increase the volume of credits. This is basically a classification problem.\n",

    "<h2>Dataset Information</h2>\n",
    "The original dataset contains 1000 entries with 20 categorial/symbolic attributes. In this dataset, each entry represents a person who takes a credit by a bank. Each person is classified as good or bad credit risks according to the set of attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The selected attributes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Age </b>(numeric)<br>\n",
    "<b>Sex </b>(text: male, female)<br>\n",
    "<b>Job </b>(numeric: 0 - unskilled and non-resident, 1 - unskilled and resident, 2 - skilled, 3 - highly skilled)<br>\n",
    "<b>Housing</b> (text: own, rent, or free)<br>\n",
    "<b>Saving accounts</b> (text - little, moderate, quite rich, rich)<br>\n",
    "<b>Checking account </b>(numeric, in DM - Deutsch Mark currency)<br>\n",
    "<b>Credit amount</b> (numeric, in DM)<br>\n",
    "<b>Duration</b> (numeric, in month)<br>\n",
    "<b>Purpose</b>(text: car, furniture/equipment, radio/TV, domestic appliances, repairs, education, business, vacation/others<br>\n",
    "<b>Risk </b> (Value target - Good or Bad Risk)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Dataset Analysis</h2>\n",
    "Before getting into any sophisticated analysis, the first step is to do an EDA and data cleaning. Since both categorical and continuous variables are included in the data set, appropriate tables and summary statistics are provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 1000 entries with 9 attributes, and classifies people as good or bad credit risks. In this quick analysis, I would like to explore the following points:\n",
    "\n",
    "The age distribution of the people getting credit loans\n",
    "How much credit do men/women usually take?\n",
    "Is there any difference between two genders in the purpose of taking credit?\n",
    "For what reason do people with low-skilled job take credit? Do people with high-skilled job behave differently?\n",
    "Before going further, I would like to know the percentage of male and female entries in this dataset. It appears that the number of male entries is double that of female. One is tempted to infer that men are willing to take credit more than women. However, based on the sample size I would say that this statement has almost no ground to hold."
